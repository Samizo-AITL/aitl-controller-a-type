# Samizo-Lab AITL Controller (A-type)

A lightweight educational implementation of the **AITL three-layer control architecture**:

```
Inner Loop : PID Controller  
Middle Loop: FSM (Finite State Machine)  
Outer Loop: LLM (Adaptive Gain Adjustment, A-type)
```

This project demonstrates a **clear and modular control-design methodology**,  
rather than achieving perfectly optimized response characteristics.

# ⚙️ 2. AITL Architecture Overview

## **2.1 PID Layer**
- variable sampling period `dt`
- integral & derivative reset
- normal / high-response gain profiles

## **2.2 FSM Layer**
Switching logic:

```
normal → high   (if |error| > threshold_high)  
high   → normal (if |error| < threshold_low)
```

Provides explainable control-mode transitions.

## **2.3 LLM Layer (A-type)**
- adjusts **kp only** when in high state  
- deterministic and interpretable  
- educational, not predictive

# 🔍 7. "Addition" — Reliability Investigation under Plant Aging

As an ongoing investigation, we are evaluating the behavior of the
AITL Controller under **long-term plant degradation** equivalent to
**1000 days of friction aging**.

The focus of this study is not peak performance, but **temporal reliability**:
whether the controller can preserve response timing (Δt)
when the plant characteristics significantly deviate from nominal conditions.

Representative simulation results indicate that:

> **AITL tends to preserve the temporal structure of the response  
> even under severe plant aging, compared with fixed-gain PID control.**

To keep this index page concise,  
detailed simulation results, figures, and interpretations
are documented separately.

👉 **See detailed analysis here:**  
- [Reliability Analysis — Plant Aging & Timing Degradation](docs/reliability/)

👉 **Design-level conclusions:**  
- [Summary — Reliability-Oriented Control Insights](docs/reliability/summary.html)

This investigation motivates the positioning of AITL as a form of  
**Reliability-Oriented Control**, where maintaining timing consistency
is treated as a primary design objective.

---

## 🟢 B-Type: Reliability-First AITL (Design Extension)

Based on the reliability investigation under plant aging,
a reliability-first architectural extension of AITL has been formulated.

This extension focuses not on performance optimization,
but on **deciding when adaptation should be restricted**.

👉 **AITL Controller B-Type (Design Documentation)**  
- Reliability-first architecture  
- FSM-based adaptation guard  
→ [docs/b_type/](docs/b_type/)

## 🛡️ True Robust Control — Operating Robustness as a Design Process

While A-Type demonstrates *adaptive capability*  
and B-Type enforces *reliability and responsibility*,

**True Robust Control** addresses a deeper question:

> **How should robustness itself be *operated*  
> before theoretical guarantees collapse?**

This theme extends the AITL framework by treating robustness  
not as a fixed design result, but as an **operational capability**.

---

### What Is Added Beyond A-Type and B-Type

True Robust Control introduces the following design concepts:

- **Uncertainty Δ as an observable state**, not a static worst-case bound
- **Frequency-aware interpretation of degradation**
  - low-frequency: performance degradation
  - high-frequency: stability margin loss
  - input-side: actuator stress and saturation
- **Proactive intervention at ∥Δ∥∞ ≈ 0.8**,  
  before H∞ theoretical guarantees break
- **Selective redesign of H∞ weight functions**
  - \( W_s \): performance demand
  - \( W_t \): robustness margin
  - \( W_u \): actuator protection
- **Strict role separation**
  - FSM decides *when* to intervene
  - LLM decides *which design lever to move*
  - Controllers execute safely without reasoning

---

### Position Within the AITL Framework

| Layer | Primary Role |
|---|---|
| A-Type | Demonstrates adaptive capability |
| B-Type | Restricts adaptation for reliability |
| **True Robust Control** | **Operates robustness as a dynamic design process** |

> **A-Type asks:** Can the system adapt?  
> **B-Type asks:** Should the system adapt?  
> **True Robust Control asks:** How should robustness be operated?

These are **complementary layers**, not competing approaches.

---

### Documentation

📘 **True Robust Control — Design Documentation**  
→ [docs/true_robust_control/](docs/true_robust_control/)

This section is recommended when:
- H∞ control feels too static or overly conservative
- Plant degradation evolves over time
- Robustness decisions must be explainable and auditable
- Design intervention must occur *before* instability
