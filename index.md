# Samizo-Lab AITL Controller (A-type)

A lightweight educational implementation of the **AITL layered control architecture**,  
designed to clearly distinguish **runtime control responsibility** and  
**design-time intelligence**.

```
Inner Loop : PID Controller  
Middle Loop: FSM (Finite State Machine, Safety & Mode Supervision)  
Adaptive Assist Layer: NN / RL (bounded, runtime optional)  
LLM: Offline / Non-Real-Time Design Assistant (A-type)
```

> **Official Architecture Definition & Reliability Boundary of AITL Controller (A-Type)**  
> This page defines the design rationale, operating assumptions,  
> and verified reliability limits of the AITL architecture.

> **Important Architectural Clarification**  
> In practical runtime systems, the valid control configurations are  
> **PID × FSM** and **PID × FSM × NN/RL (bounded)**.  
>  
> **LLM is used exclusively outside the real-time control loop**  
> for analysis, design review, and documentation purposes.

This project demonstrates a **clear and modular control-design methodology**,  
rather than achieving perfectly optimized response characteristics  
or autonomous intelligence.

# ⚙️ 2. AITL Architecture Overview

## **2.1 PID Layer**
- variable sampling period `dt`
- integral & derivative reset
- normal / high-response gain profiles  

**Role:**  
Provides deterministic stability and baseline performance in real time.

---

## **2.2 FSM Layer**
Switching logic:

```
normal → high   (if |error| > threshold_high)  
high   → normal (if |error| < threshold_low)
```

Provides **explainable and auditable** control-mode transitions.

**Role:**  
- supervises safety and mode selection  
- gates whether adaptive assistance is permitted  
- provides explicit fallback behavior  

---

## **2.3 Adaptive Assist Layer (NN / RL, A-type)**
- applies a **bounded assist term** under FSM supervision  
- improves recovery timing only within a verified operating region  
- educational and reproducible (not a claim of universal optimality)  

> **Note (Runtime Validity):**  
> The recommended runtime configurations are **PID × FSM** and **PID × FSM × NN/RL (bounded)**.

---

## **2.4 LLM (Offline Design Assistant, A-type)**
- used **exclusively outside the real-time control loop**  
- supports **log analysis**, **design review**, and **documentation**  
- may propose parameter updates, but does **not** execute control actions in real time  

**Strict prohibitions:**  
- no real-time I/O  
- no direct gain injection during runtime  
- no FSM state or transition control  

---

## 🔍 Reliability Investigation — Plant Aging

> **Purpose (Normative):**  
> This investigation provides **design evidence** to identify  
> the **operational reliability boundary** of A-Type.  
> It does **not** modify runtime control authority.

Beyond ideal conditions, the AITL controller was evaluated under  
**severe long-term plant degradation**, modeled as  
**friction aging equivalent to 1000 days**.

The objective of this investigation is **not to claim superiority**,  
but to **identify the operational boundary** of adaptive control.

The primary focus is **temporal reliability**:

- recovery timing consistency (Δt)
- degradation detectability
- explicit criteria for **when adaptation must be restricted**

---

### Representative Result — Aging Sweep (Δt vs Aging)

  alt="Reliability metrics vs aging"
  style="display:block; margin:1.5rem auto; width:80%; max-width:100%;"
/>

---

### Interpretation (Design-Relevant, Not Marketing)

This result demonstrates that:

- **all controllers degrade** as plant aging progresses  
- **AITL improves recovery timing only within a limited aging range**
- beyond that range, continued adaptation **does not preserve temporal reliability**
- the degradation trend is **explicitly measurable via Δt**

Crucially, this means:

> **AITL is effective only within a clearly identifiable operating region.**

Outside that region, adaptation must be **restricted or stopped by design**.

---

### Why This Result Matters

This analysis does **not** argue that AITL is universally better.

Instead, it establishes that:

- adaptive control has a **finite, observable reliability boundary**
- that boundary can be detected **before instability or failure**
- Δt serves as a **design-time and run-time decision metric**

In other words, the result answers:

> **“Until when is AITL safe to use?”**

—not merely *“Does it work?”*

---

### Design Implication

This finding directly motivates a **reliability-first extension**:

- **A-Type**: demonstrates adaptive capability  
- **B-Type**: decides *whether adaptation should be allowed*

The reliability investigation provides the **evidence layer**
that makes B-Type a **necessary architectural evolution**,  
not a conceptual add-on.

---

### Further Details

Detailed waveforms, quantitative metrics, and explainable supervisory logic  
are documented separately.

---

### One-Line Summary

> **AITL is not always beneficial — and that fact is measurable.**  
>  
> This investigation identifies the operating region  
> where adaptive control should be applied — and where it should not.

---

## 🟢 B-Type: Reliability-First AITL (Design Extension)

The A-Type results demonstrate that **adaptive control has a finite reliability boundary**.  
Beyond a certain aging or degradation range, continued adaptation may degrade  
**temporal reliability (Δt)** rather than improve performance.

**B-Type** is a design extension that transforms this empirical boundary into an
explicit **operational rule** by introducing a dedicated
**reliability permission layer**.

---

### What B-Type Adds (Conceptual)

B-Type does **not** aim to maximize performance.  
Instead, it determines **whether adaptation is permitted** based on
monitored reliability conditions.

Typical monitored quantities include:

- **Δt**: recovery time / temporal reliability
- **max‖e‖**: safety envelope (worst-case deviation)
- **‖ΔKp‖ or dKp/dt**: adaptation aggressiveness (stability risk)

---

### Core Idea

> **A-Type proves adaptation capability.**  
> **B-Type enforces adaptation responsibility.**

Adaptive tuning is enabled only when reliability metrics satisfy
design-time acceptance criteria.
If these conditions are violated, the system **restricts adaptation**
and falls back to a conservative operating mode
(e.g., fixed-gain PID control).

## 🛡️ True Robust Control — Operating Robustness as a Design Process

While A-Type demonstrates *adaptive capability*  
and B-Type enforces *reliability and responsibility*,

**True Robust Control** addresses a deeper question:

> **How should robustness itself be *operated*  
> before theoretical guarantees collapse?**

This theme extends the AITL framework by treating robustness  
not as a fixed design result, but as an **operational capability**.

---

### What Is Added Beyond A-Type and B-Type

True Robust Control introduces the following design concepts:

- **Uncertainty Δ as an observable state**, not a static worst-case bound
- **Frequency-aware interpretation of degradation**
  - low-frequency: performance degradation
  - high-frequency: stability margin loss
  - input-side: actuator stress and saturation
- **Proactive intervention before robustness guarantees collapse**
- **Selective redesign of robustness weight functions**
  - $$W_s$$: performance demand  
  - $$W_t$$: robustness margin  
  - $$W_u$$: actuator protection
- **Strict role separation**
  - FSM decides *when* to intervene
  - LLM decides *which design lever to move* (**offline only**)
  - Controllers execute safely without reasoning

---

### Position Within the AITL Framework

| Layer | Primary Role |
|---|---|
| A-Type | Demonstrates adaptive capability |
| B-Type | Restricts adaptation for reliability |
| **True Robust Control** | **Operates robustness as a dynamic design process** |

> **A-Type asks:** Can the system adapt?  
> **B-Type asks:** Should the system adapt?  
> **True Robust Control asks:** How should robustness be operated?

These layers are **complementary**, not competing.

---

### Documentation

📘 **True Robust Control — Design Documentation**  
→ [**docs/true_robust_control/**](docs/true_robust_control/)

This section is recommended when:
- H∞ control feels too static or overly conservative
- plant degradation evolves over time
- robustness decisions must be explainable and auditable
- design intervention must occur *before* instability
