# Samizo-Lab AITL Controller (A-type)

A lightweight educational implementation of the **AITL three-layer control architecture**:

```
Inner Loop : PID Controller  
Middle Loop: FSM (Finite State Machine)  
Outer Loop: LLM (Adaptive Gain Adjustment, A-type)
```

This project demonstrates a **clear and modular control-design methodology**,  
rather than achieving perfectly optimized response characteristics.

# ⚙️ 2. AITL Architecture Overview

## **2.1 PID Layer**
- variable sampling period `dt`
- integral & derivative reset
- normal / high-response gain profiles

## **2.2 FSM Layer**
Switching logic:

```
normal → high   (if |error| > threshold_high)  
high   → normal (if |error| < threshold_low)
```

Provides explainable control-mode transitions.

## **2.3 LLM Layer (A-type)**
- adjusts **kp only** when in high state  
- deterministic and interpretable  
- educational, not predictive
