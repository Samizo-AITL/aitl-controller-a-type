# Samizo-Lab AITL Controller (A-type)

A lightweight educational implementation of the **AITL layered control architecture**,  
explicitly designed to clarify **runtime control responsibility** and  
**design-time intelligence** in industrial systems.

```
Inner Loop : PID Controller  
Middle Loop: FSM (Finite State Machine, Safety & Mode Supervision)  
Adaptive Assist Layer: NN / RL (Bounded ε-term, Runtime Optional)  
LLM: Offline / Non-Real-Time Design Assistant (Design Review & Documentation Only)
```

> **Official Architecture Definition & Reliability Boundary of AITL Controller (A-Type)**  
> This page defines the design rationale, operating assumptions,  
> and verified reliability limits of the AITL architecture.

> **Important Architectural Constraint (Normative)**  
> Valid runtime configurations are **PID × FSM** and  
> **PID × FSM × NN/RL (bounded ε-term)**.  
>  
> **LLM is never part of the real-time control loop.**

This project demonstrates a **clear and modular control-design methodology**,  
not a claim of universal optimality or autonomous intelligence.

# 🧱 1. Project Structure

（※ 構成は原文どおり、変更なし）

---

# ⚙️ 2. AITL Architecture Overview

## **2.1 PID Layer**
- variable sampling period `dt`
- integral & derivative reset
- normal / high-response gain profiles  

**Role:**  
Provides deterministic stability and baseline performance in real time.

---

## **2.2 FSM Layer**

```
normal → high   (if |error| > threshold_high)  
high   → normal (if |error| < threshold_low)
```

Provides **explainable and auditable** control-mode transitions.

**Role:**  
- safety supervision  
- mode selection  
- gating of adaptive assistance  

FSM holds the **final runtime authority**.

---

## **2.3 Adaptive Assist Layer (NN / RL, A-Type)**

Adaptive assistance is implemented **only** as a **bounded ε-term**.

- enabled or disabled by FSM  
- never replaces PID control  
- never rewrites FSM logic  

Its purpose is to:
- compensate gradual aging and drift
- improve recovery timing **within a verified operating region**

It is **not intended** for:
- autonomous optimization
- direct control command generation
- unbounded online learning

---

## **2.4 LLM (Offline Design Assistant)**

LLM is used **exclusively outside runtime** for:

- analysis of logs and reliability metrics (Δt, max‖e‖)
- generation of design alternatives
- documentation and audit support

**LLM is strictly prohibited from:**
- real-time I/O
- direct gain injection
- FSM state or transition control

## 🔍 Reliability Investigation — Plant Aging

> **Scope Clarification (Normative)**  
> This investigation evaluates the **operational reliability boundary** of A-Type.  
> It does **not** modify the runtime architecture defined in Section 2.

Beyond ideal conditions, the AITL controller was evaluated under  
**severe long-term plant degradation**, modeled as  
**friction aging equivalent to 1000 days**.

The objective of this investigation is **not to claim superiority**,  
but to **identify the operational boundary** of adaptive control.

The primary focus is **temporal reliability**:

- recovery timing consistency (Δt)
- degradation detectability
- explicit criteria for **when adaptation must be restricted**

---

### Representative Result — Aging Sweep (Δt vs Aging)

  alt="Reliability metrics vs aging"
  style="display:block; margin:1.5rem auto; width:80%; max-width:100%;"
/>

---

### Interpretation (Design-Relevant, Not Marketing)

This result demonstrates that:

- **all controllers degrade** as plant aging progresses  
- **AITL improves recovery timing only within a limited range**
- beyond that range, adaptation **harms temporal reliability**
- the degradation trend is **explicitly measurable via Δt**

> **AITL is effective only within a clearly identifiable operating region.**

---

### Why This Result Matters

This analysis establishes that:

- adaptive control has a **finite, observable reliability boundary**
- the boundary is detectable **before instability**
- Δt serves as a **design-time and run-time decision metric**

---

### Design Implication

This evidence motivates a **reliability-first extension**:

- **A-Type**: demonstrates adaptive capability  
- **B-Type**: decides *whether adaptation should be allowed*

---

## 🟢 B-Type: Reliability-First AITL

B-Type introduces an explicit **adaptation permission layer**.

- determines whether adaptation is allowed
- never optimizes performance
- enforces fallback to conservative control

👉 Documentation: `docs/b_type/`

---

## 🛡️ True Robust Control — Operating Robustness

True Robust Control treats robustness as an **operational process**.

- FSM decides **when** to intervene
- LLM proposes **what to redesign (offline)**
- controllers execute deterministically
