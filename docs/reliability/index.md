# Reliability Analysis — AITL under Plant Aging (1000 days)

This section provides a **reliability-oriented analysis** of the  
**AITL Controller A-Type** under **long-term plant degradation**,  
modeled as **friction aging equivalent to 1000 days**.

Unlike conventional performance-driven evaluations,  
the focus here is on **temporal reliability**:

- timing consistency (Δt)
- motion authority preservation
- and explicit decisions on *when adaptation should be stopped*

## Purpose and Scope

The goal of this analysis is **not** to optimize controller performance.

Instead, it aims to answer the following design questions:

- How does plant aging affect response timing?
- What does adaptive control *actually* preserve?
- When does adaptation begin to **harm reliability**?
- Can this degradation be **quantified and detected by design**?

The analysis compares:

- fixed-gain PID control  
- AITL control with FSM-based adaptive gain retuning  

under identical friction aging conditions.

## Analysis Structure (Demo Mapping)

This reliability study is organized as a **design-to-evidence sequence**,
linking **architectural intent** to **reproducible results**.

Rather than independent experiments, each demo represents a
**progressive refinement of reliability reasoning**.

| Demo | Artifact | Role |
|------|----------|------|
| **12** | `12_vi_current_control_sales_demo.py` | Phenomenon visualization (waveforms under aging & disturbance) |
| **13** | `13_aging_sweep_delta_t.py` | Quantitative reliability metrics (Δt, max|e| vs aging) |
| **15** | `15_fsm_explainability_demo.py` | Explainable supervisory decisions (FSM transition rationale) |
| **—** | *(design synthesis)* | Reliability boundary identification (motivation for B-Type) |

### Interpretation

- **Demo 12** answers *what happens* under aging and disturbance  
- **Demo 13** quantifies *how reliability degrades* using explicit metrics  
- **Demo 15** explains *why supervisory decisions occur*, enabling auditability  

Together, these demos establish that:

- performance recovery alone is insufficient to guarantee reliability
- temporal consistency (Δt) must be monitored explicitly
- adaptive actions require **design-time permission and stopping logic**

This sequence defines the **design boundary of the A-Type controller** and
provides the **evidence base** motivating a reliability-oriented **B-Type architecture**.

Each demo builds on the previous one and represents a  
**design-phase progression**, not isolated experiments.

## 🔬 Demonstration Results (Reproducible Evidence)

This section presents **direct, reproducible results** generated from the
Python demos in `demos/` and stored in `data/`.

All figures below are **auto-generated** and traceable to code.

---

### 1) V–I Current Control under Aging & Disturbance

Waveform comparison of **Fixed PID / PID×FSM / AITL** under:
- resistance (friction-equivalent) aging
- external current disturbance

![V–I current control demo](../../data/12_vi_current_control_sales_demo.png)

**Observations**
- Fixed PID: recovery depends on nominal tuning
- PID×FSM: supervised gain switching improves robustness
- AITL: adaptive recovery under degradation

Waveforms alone are **not sufficient** to judge reliability.
Quantitative metrics follow.

---

### 2) Reliability & Safety Metrics vs Aging (Δt, max|e|)

Aging sweep over resistance step ratio (ΔR/R0), evaluating:
- **Δt**: recovery/settling time (temporal reliability)
- **max|e|**: worst deviation (safety envelope)

![Aging sweep metrics](../../data/13_aging_sweep_delta_t.png)

**Interpretation**
- Δt increases with aging for all controllers
- AITL maintains comparable safety (max|e|)
- Temporal reliability degradation becomes **explicit and measurable**

---

### 3) FSM Explainability — Why Adaptation Switched

Explicit visualization and logs explaining **why FSM mode switches occurred**,
based on thresholded error magnitude.

![FSM explainability demo](../../data/15_fsm_explainability_demo.png)

**What this proves**
- Supervisory decisions are deterministic
- Mode switches are auditable and timestamped
- FSM-based adaptation is **not a black box**

---

## Reproducibility

All results shown above are generated by the following scripts:

- `demos/12_vi_current_control_sales_demo.py`
- `demos/13_aging_sweep_delta_t.py`
- `demos/15_fsm_explainability_demo.py`

Generated figures are stored in:

- `data/12_vi_current_control_sales_demo.png`
- `data/13_aging_sweep_delta_t.png`
- `data/15_fsm_explainability_demo.png`

No manual post-processing is applied.

## Reliability Design Conclusion (Evidence-Based)

Based on the results above:

- Adaptive control can compensate for aging-induced delay
- Adaptation may degrade temporal reliability
- This degradation is detectable by design-time metrics (Δt)
- FSM-based logic can decide **when adaptation should be stopped**

These results define the **design boundary** of the A-Type controller and
motivate a **B-Type architecture explicitly designed for reliability control**.

---

## Key Design Message

> **Adaptive control is not automatically reliable.**

In this study, AITL successfully compensates for delay,  
but at the cost of:

- excessive lead (over-compensation)
- reduced motion authority
- and degraded overall reliability

Crucially, these effects are:

- **not obvious from waveforms alone**
- but become explicit through Δt, amplitude, and FSM logic

This distinction marks the boundary between  
*performance optimization* and *reliability-oriented design*.

- The index page presents only representative conclusions.
- Detailed reasoning, metrics, and design implications are contained here.

---

## Summary

This reliability chapter demonstrates that:

- timing degradation can be quantified (Δt)
- authority loss can be detected (amplitude ratio)
- adaptive behavior can and **should be stopped by design**

The result is not a failure of AITL,  
but a **clear design boundary** between:

> *Adaptive* control  
> and  
> *Reliable adaptive* control

---

## Design Implication and Next Step

The A-Type controller successfully demonstrated adaptive control capability
under plant aging conditions.

While the feasibility of reliability-oriented control was investigated,
the current A-Type architecture was not designed to guarantee reliability,
as adaptive actions may degrade timing consistency and motion authority.

This result clarifies the design boundary of the A-Type controller and
motivates the investigation of a **B-Type architecture explicitly designed
for reliability control**, in which adaptive actions are evaluated and
accepted only if overall reliability is improved.
