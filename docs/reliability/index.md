# Reliability Analysis — AITL under Plant Aging (1000 days)

This document provides detailed simulation results and interpretations
for the plant-aging investigation briefly introduced in the index page.

Focus:
- friction aging equivalent to 1000 days
- timing degradation (Δt)
- comparison between fixed-gain PID and AITL
